## Caption Description: 
Create a single web page that fits the following requirements:
- Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)
- Each page must validate at validator.w3.org.
- Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least two unique views
- You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages.  (If this requirement doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that fulfills it.  You can always unlink it after you have been peer -graded.
- Each page must be styled.  The goal is not to impress, but to show competence.  So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules.  But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
